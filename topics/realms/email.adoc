[[_email]]

=== Email Settings

{{book.project.name}} sends emails to users to verify their email address, when they forget their passwords, or when an admin needs to
receive notifications about a server event.
To enable {{book.project.name}} to send emails you need to provide {{book.project.name}} with your SMTP server settings.
This is configured per realm.  Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu
item and click the `Email` tab.

As emails are used for recovering usernames and passwords it's recommended to use secure connection, especially if the SMTP server is on an external network.
To enable connecting to SSL/TLS port click on `Enable SSL` or to enable protocol upgrade using StartTLS, click on `Enable StartTLS`.
For 'Enable SSL' you will most likely also need to change the `Port` (the default port for SSL/TLS is 465).

If your SMTP server requires authentication click on `Enable Authentication` and insert the `Username` and `Password`.
